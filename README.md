# Genesis-Ubuntu-Install

You might find yourself needing to install or re-install Ubuntu, for example after a PC crash. We wanted to document the steps we take to make this process as smooth as possible.

## Online Tutorials / Instructions

The website [It's Foss](https://itsfoss.com) is usually a great resource for all things related to Linux. 

They have great tutorials possible steps to take after installing Ubuntu, like this one: [Things to do After Installing Ubuntu 18.04 and 18.10](https://itsfoss.com/things-to-do-after-installing-ubuntu-18-04/).

Follow their instructions to build a solid Ubuntu environment for your computer.
